Abstract
The world of sustainability reporting and impact measurement faces a triple challenge: scaling adoption
while speeding up change and ensuring mutual support of states, civil society, and businesses.
Organizations dedicated to the development of various methodologies have become a key to the growth
of information ecosystems of producers, users, and intermediaries of sustainability and financial data.
Our report is a primer on agile models in this highly active field for an audience of professional leaders
engaged in the development and testing across sectors, disciplines, and fields. The findings of this report
are the outcome of prior academic research, practitioner engagement and the pilot of the first global
sprint. This pilot - the first of its kind - focused on the measurement and valuation of Greenhouse Gas
Emissions (GHG) and Occupational Health and Safety (OHS) with participants in Europe and Asia.
We introduce first-hand experience with the "sprint model" in global standard and method
development, as it is emerging beyond its original fields of software and product development.

I. Introduction
It took over a decade to establish a measurement system for the Millennium Development Goals and
the subsequent Sustainability Development Goals. Most reporting standards will not be in widespread
use before 2025. When the first full assurance reports arrive, the global community will have less than
five years to work towards the sustainable development goals and halving global carbon emissions by
2030 to achieve net zero. The costs of this “evaluative infrastructure” (Kornberger et al., 2017) is
estimated at around USD 250 billion – excluding opportunity costs of measuring the wrong things or
measuring the right things incorrectly (Jerven, 2019; UN Statistics, 2019). While artificial intelligence
can form part of the solution (Efremova, West, Zausaev, 2019), more important than “what” to measure
(Stiglitz, Sen, Fitoussi, 2008) is the way “how” measurements and human judgments are formed.
The world of sustainability reporting and impact valuation, thus, faces a triple challenge: scaling
adoption while speeding up change and ensuring mutual support of states, civil society, and businesses.
Organizations dedicated to the development of various methodologies have become important drivers
in the growth of information ecosystems of producers, users, and intermediaries of sustainability and
financial data. But economic and political turbulence, as well as intensifying environmental and social
crises, introduce new constraints and complexity. Thus, traditional waterfall project management based
on sequential stages and forecasting of future cash flows becomes insufficient. New expert-led and
industry-driven task forces, initiatives, and alliances imply a certain "agility" – an ability to move and
think quickly and intelligently.1  Cross-sector partnerships and interdisciplinary teams experiment with
new development approaches that are more responsive to different and changing needs through road-
testing and piloting. This heightened activity demonstrates impact measurement's "imperative" role in
distinguishing between expected and actual performance.2
Our report is a primer on agile models in this highly active field for an audience of professional leaders
engaged in the development and testing across sectors, disciplines, and fields. The findings of this report
are the outcome of prior academic research, practitioner engagement and the pilot of the first global
sprint on impact measurement and valuation. This pilot - the first of its kind - focused on the
measurement and valuation of Greenhouse Gas Emissions (GHG) and Occupational Health and Safety
(OHS) with participants in Europe and Asia. We introduce first-hand experience with the "sprint
model" in global standard and method development, as it is emerging beyond its original fields of
software and product development.3

Initiatives in sustainability reporting, impact measurement, and valuation usually prepare, issue and seek
feedback on general conceptual frameworks prior to developing issue- and sector-specific standards. An
important preparatory task is to define the purpose, principles, and key terminology by which those
specific standards are set. This includes the qualitative characteristics of the information and the
distinction between dependencies and impacts.4 Figure 1  explains the interrelation of sustainability
reporting, impact measurement and valuation.

For the purposes of this report, we consider impact as the (actual or potential) links between (a)
corporate activities and social-environmental changes and (b) between external risks, dependencies, and
changes in corporations. We consider measurement and valuation as:
-
the process of judgment based on facts, values, and standards of performance and accountability
-
set of qualitative and quantitative methods for measurement, calculation, and financial
evaluation for decision-making and reporting
This report collects the views of professional experts on the potential pathways to develop valuation
factors5and methods that can meet those ambitions. Impact valuation presents a fertile ground for agile
models with regard to monetization models and their numerical inputs. Developing standards and
methodologies in general and for GHG and OHS alone is an epic effort. This calculative practice sits at
the intersection of measuring and managing impacts linked to policy objects. It aims to enable decision-
makers to operationalize high-level policy objectives. As shown in Figure 2, this somewhat circular
process of determining the relevance of information. Thus, it has a role to play in the catalytic processes
of highlighting, orchestrating, and operationalizing systems change.6  Our report sheds light on the
complexity and abstraction as integral to this work. While more attention is paid to KPIs and valuation
factors, consensus-building and learning about standards, methods, and processes remains a costly and
ongoing task. On this journey, critiques of reductionism and over-specification arise from civil society
and industry alike. And they remind us of the shared goal to move from measuring to managing impacts.

II. The State of the Art and Science
1.
How does the Sprint Model work, and why does it matter?
What does it mean when the Taskforce for Nature-Related Financial Disclosures takes an “open
innovation” approach?7 In times of rapid technological, economic, social, and ecological change8 all
work is “work in progress”. The “state” of the art and science – a legal term to designate knowledge and
inventions generated and published at an effective date for the allocation of intellectual property rights
- is constantly in flux. It still serves as a reference point for organizations and people to structure the
division of labor and collaboration. The sprint model, first introduced as the "Climate Sprint" in 2023,
adapts agile development methods or "scrum" from software engineering to systems innovations such as
standard-setting and methodology development.9 The model synchronizes distributed action and
utilizes the force of routines for open innovation across organizational boundaries and levels.10 Beyond
business units and functions, it allows for self-organizing teams to achieve a common outcome with
high-intensity work in a limited time window. This section provides an overview of sprints in the context
of the development of standards and methods of impact measurement and valuation.11

A sprint is based on clear processes and roles within the sprint team. This cyclical process is divided into
four iterating sub-processes as follows:
1. generate an idea of the intended result;
2. break down large problems into addressable components;
3. manage the execution of mutually agreed upon tasks; and
4. adjusts progress and learns from previous successes and failures.
The phases described above range from sprint planning to the actual sprint with regular scrum meetings
over a predetermined period of time, which are concluded by a demo day and sprint review. As part of
the planning, team members must commit to a common "definition of done" (DOD) - the point at
which the sprint is successfully concluded. This DOD needs to balance achievability and ambition.
The Sprint Team, Solution Owner, and Sprint Master, as the main sprint roles, are intimately related to
this process. The Sprint Team, a group of individuals who are doing the work, are cross-functional such
that the team has enough skills to achieve the sprint goals. It is self-organized and decided on how to best
deliver on the tasks.
The Sprint Master ensures that the team complies with the Scrum process. The Sprint Master is in
charge of communication amongst team members, i.e. facilitating the planned and ad-hoc meetings
(daily Scrum, planning and review meetings). The Sprint Master operates as well as a coach to help the
Owner and team maximize value from the process and remove impediments. The Scrum Master has a
unique role of checks and balances to ensure the integrity of the process and, therefore, neither be
performed by a member of the team nor may perform any of the technical work.
The Solution Owner (or simply Owner) is an individual that ensures the vision is kept in the Sprint
output. The Owner will prioritize the backlog and give feedback on the new feature. This role requires
not performing any work.

Sprint resources and tools centre around a Kanban sprint board, which is a dynamic list of cards. Those
cards represent one actionable task. The title of the lists varies but are in the following order: "backlog",

"planned", "to do", "in progress", "review", and "done". They can be promoted to the next list upon
completion, passed on to review and finally piled on to the "done" list. Tasks can also be relegated to the
previous list if it fails the testing, at which point the task needs another iteration. The sprint backlog is a
list of tasks that defines an actionable feature to develop an item - e.g. an impact indicator or a valuation
factor.

Secondly, the climate action field - climate issues are initially prioritized by influential bodies such as the
OECD, the Financial Stability Board's TCFD or the IFRS ISSB - demonstrates many similar challenges
that the software industry and other industrial sectors have already addressed, such as the International
Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors' roadmap following Moore's Law. Climate actions (and in
any other sustainability area) serve beneficiaries' needs that vary by geographical location, demographic
structure, level of income and other characteristics. The teams that engage in climate action need to
embark on transition pathways that last decades. During those long time spans, demands change, and
new people take over. Reporting, valuation, and measurement are seen as key to accelerating this
transition which, in turn, requires more integration and coordination of the information ecosystem
across industry sectors.
Thirdly, the emergence of many information technology service providers addressing the "data gap" in
sustainability reporting and impact measurement has introduced the logic of digitalization and
automation. Large data providers acquire specialist startups and expand their product lines to include

digitized sustainability reporting and impact measurement services. "ESG tech startups" combine the
promises of fintech and climate tech to market solutions offering data analytics, automation, and
artificial intelligence for data collection, materiality assessment, verification, valuation, reporting,
investing, and many, many other needs of the world of sustainability. Not only corporates and investors
but also standard-setters and methodology developers are adapting their work to this landscape. To
make use of the opportunities promised by those technologies and software applications, they
complement their traditional due process with more agile development methods.
To summarize, the process, roles, and elements of the sprint model provide a way to respond to rapid
changes and collaborate in multidisciplinary teams and across different organizations. Each organization
and team member knows their own role and those of others. The sprint model provides a system to
effectively organize the drafting and review of standards, the generation of prototypes for methods, and
their feasibility testing in organizational processes with multiple feedback loops for learning and
adaptation to enhance usefulness. Ultimately, it also paves the way for the digitization of reporting
through XBRL and other machine-readable languages and applications for automation.

2.
Application to Impact Measurement and Valuation
Agile development models require clarity about the "backlog" of tasks prior to, during, and after sprints.
Agile models are flexible and iterative in project management, focused on collaboration, adaptability,
and continuous improvement. The model allows for frequent feedback, promotes adaptability to
complex and changing requirements, encourages collaboration between cross-functional teams, and
enables the delivery of high-quality content in shorter iterations at different organizational levels. Impact
measurement and valuation initiatives operate in a field of changing and ever-increasing policy
requirements that afford interdisciplinarity among knowledge carriers. The metrics selected in this
report are drawn from the Guidance on Core Indicators for entity reporting on contribution towards
implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals published by UNCTAD.
Initiatives in the field of impact measurement and valuation deal with complex systems and issues that
contain many feedback loops and unknowns. Complexity introduces uncertainty and variability into
measurement and valuation. This section adapts the idea of the "sprint backlog" (see __ above) to the
universe of potential impact indicators and valuation factors by way of tracking their development on
two vertical and horizontal axes that express how certain the relevant expert communities are about a)
the policy objectives of standards and b) the cause-effect of their underlying impacts measures.
Indicators and valuation factors, thus, become objects of measurement themselves, rendering their
development more comprehensible and accountable. We adapt the high-level indicator framework to
corporate indicators in what we call the Agile Indicator Board. This device can act like a quality control

mechanism for the design and use of indicators themselves, thus closes the feedback loop between
producers, users, and intermediaries of information. As a sprint board, it can be used in the same way as
Kanban or scrum boards for task management and team leadership.

Figure 7: Overview of the Core SDG Indicator Framework as per the UN Statistics Office.


Figure 8: The Corresponding Agile Indicator Board for the Development of Indicators and Valuation Factors.


Thus, this indicator tracking device is dynamic, which means that an indicator or valuation factor can
be promoted to a higher or relegated to a lower tier based on new scientific evidence or a change in policy
consensus. The framework fulfils the same role as a Kanban-style board for a sprint where tasks are
moved out of the backlog to the "in progress", "review", and "done" list or backwards.
It is important to note that the tier system of classifying indicators is not entirely new. The United
Nations Statistics Division and other national statistics offices are reviewing and refining their indicator
frameworks to enhance the validity and reliability of the methods of counting by which data is
produced. For those agencies, the review of indicator frameworks is an important quality mechanism.

indicators (248, including repeating ones).12 The Inter-Agency and Expert Group on Sustainable
Development Goal Indicators (IAEG-SDGs), whose members are representatives of national statistical
offices and the Chair of the UN Statistical Commission, as well as observers from other international
and regional agencies.

The SDG Indicator Framework focuses on governmental reporting. Conceptual frameworks designed
for corporate financial and sustainability reporting have some parallels. The implementation of an
indicator depends on its development degree - or tier - and this assessment has different consequences
for its subsequent treatment. While Tier I indicators are "good to go", they will still be subject to regular
review. Tier II indicators may be implemented partially wherever feasible (regionally or sectorally), but
their emphasis is on capacity building. For Tier III indicators, more efforts are required to develop the
methodology.
Reporting and impact measurement for corporations show considerable differences. Important
differences are the object of accounting, the type and granularity of data, the level of aggregation, the
data flow of reporting, and its distinction between general disclosures and sector-specific disclosures.
Impact measurement and valuation on the corporate level and its value chain network operate in a
distributed information ecosystem with different norms, expectations, and knowledge bases. While
learning from the Global Indicator Framework for SDGs, the differences must be reflected in the
tracking of indicators for corporate entities.
The horizontal axis tracks the level of certainty about casual relationships of impacts and dependencies.
Those fundamental quantities are found in the physical and social systems, such as carbon emissions or
human health, and relate to the object of accounting. The causal relationships between those
phenomena and the impacts and dependencies in the corporate context need to be contextualized
within the organization and its global value chain networks. The objects of accounting - in our case
GHG and OHS indicators - require an understanding of the carbon cycle in the ecological system and

the health and well-being of people in social systems to determine the fundamental flows and stocks.
Once this is sufficiently clarified, the focus shifts from the systems at large to the corporate entity as a
participant in this system. Experts need to map the logical stream of inputs, activities, outputs,
outcomes, and impacts of an entity on the system and vice versa.
The second vertical axis tracks the level of certainty about policy objectives of, standards and methods.
Those objectives are found in policy declarations, legislation, and regulations but also conceptual
frameworks and technical guidance. The degree of certainty on both axes follows different logics. While
thresholds for evidence and norms for accuracy and validity for causal relationships of impacts and
dependencies tend to follow the scientific discourse, more interpretative discretion exists when relevant
communities of experts set the boundaries of an entity across time and space. Scientific consensus and
its translation by professional experts will determine if, when and how impacts can be attributed to
organizational entity.
The corresponding Agile Indicator Board structures uncertainty and ambiguity around measuring
corporate impacts in a different way based on informativeness and actionability of the indicator. Central
to this typology is the distinction of the following indicators:

extension, in impact measurement and valuation, the appropriateness of standards and methods is
determined by their "decision usefulness".
The  SDG Indicator Framework leads us to SDG Indicator 12.6.1 - the number of companies publishing
sustainability reports. This indicator is based on target 12.6 explicitly encourages companies, especially
large and transnational companies, to adopt sustainable practices and to integrate sustainability
information into their reporting cycles. The underlying policy objective rests on Sustainable
Development Goal 12 - sustainable consumption and production. To operationalize indicator 12.6.1,
UNCTAD - the responsible agency alongside UNEP - Guidance on Core Indicators  Sustainability and
SDG Impact Reporting is prepared and regularly updated by UNCTAD and enhanced by UNEP and
the UN Statistical Division.
The stated purpose of the guidance is not to provide a standard for sustainability reporting but primarily
to assist governments in their SDG measurement. However, the document became more influential
than publicly recognized, as "core" indicators sounded like a minimum requirement to many actors in
the global accounting arena. With the IFRS ISSB mandated to create a global baseline, the UN Core
Indicators anchor the attention on the feasibility of impact measurement and valuation in jurisdictions
where the institutional setting may not meet any
minimum reporting expectations.
Together with other global guidance documents, the UN
Core Indicators provide a starting point to assess
corporate KPIs and valuation factors within the tracking
framework outlined in this chapter. The Core Indicators
are not developed from scratch and do not follow a single
conceptual framework. Rather, they are selected from an
existing universe of key initiatives or reporting
frameworks that feature in published corporate reports.
The selection criteria can be separated into a first-order
assessment of appropriateness and a second-order
assessment of the usefulness of the specific indicator.
While the former is concerned with how generally
accepted t, the indicator is, the latter determines how technically feasible or calculable it is. A detailed
discussion of the criteria will follow in Chapter 3 when we discuss the user experience of indicators. The
first-order assessment of appropriateness entails considering three crucial factors: relevance to the
Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) goals, targets, and indicator framework; interoperability with
the existing indicator universe; and universality to all reporting entities. Relevance to SDG goals, targets,
and indicator framework is essential in ensuring that the chosen indicators align with the global agenda
for sustainable development. By evaluating how well the indicators contribute to the desired outcomes

## Page 15

15
and progress towards the SDGs, the process ascertains their suitability for measuring and monitoring
sustainable development efforts.
Interoperability with the existing indicator universe (e.g. ISSB, GRI) is crucial for harmonizing data
collection and reporting processes. It involves evaluating the compatibility and integration of the
indicators with the established frameworks, standards, and systems already in place and forthcoming.
This step ensures data exchange, comparability, and consistency across various reporting entities and
avoids ESG data gaps. Universality to all reporting entities emphasizes the importance of inclusivity and
accessibility. The chosen indicators should be applicable and relevant to diverse organizations, sectors,
and regions. Considering the diverse nature of reporting entities, the process covers that the indicators
are universally applicable and facilitates consistent and comprehensive reporting of sustainable
development progress.
The second-order assessment of usefulness involves evaluating several key aspects to determine the value
and effectiveness of selected indicators. These factors include comparability across industries,
controllability over issues and data collection, the capability of consistent measurement, suitability for
consolidated reporting and legal entity reporting, and connectivity between financial and non-financial
reporting principles and data. Comparability across industries is vital to ensure that the chosen
indicators can be applied consistently across different sectors. Controllability over issues and data
collection refers to the ability of reporting entities to influence and manage the aspects covered by the
indicators. The capability of consistent measurement is crucial for reliable and accurate reporting.
Indicators should be defined in a manner that allows for consistent measurement over time, facilitating
meaningful trend analysis and monitoring of sustainability performance. Suitability for consolidated
reporting and legal entity reporting involves assessing whether the selected indicators can accommodate
the reporting needs of different levels, such as group-level or individual legal entities. Connectivity
between financial and non-financial reporting principles and data recognizes the importance of
integrating sustainability information with financial reporting.
To conclude, developers of sustainability reporting standards, impact measurement and valuation
methods took some considerable steps towards joining corporate impacts to the stocks and flows of their
underlying fundamental quanta. Organizations, professional experts, and business leaders engage in
breaking down those ambitions into concrete, feasible tasks. This is why tracking the development status
of a specific indicator or valuation factor is useful to determine where standardization efforts are at any
given point in time and what next steps need to be taken.

Key Learnings from the Pilot Sprint
This section discusses key learnings that follow from the pilot sprint's work about the development of
indicators and valuation factors. A full list of sprint resources for indicators and valuation factors is

available in the appendix of this working paper. Following the introduction of a tracking framework for
corporate indicators, we now turn to the key learnings for the development of key performance
indicators and impact valuation factors. We now apply the Agile Indicator Board to some of the current
challenges of impact measurement and valuation.
Measuring and valuing impact is primarily about making visible the interventions of an entity in social
and ecological systems. The complexity arises from the basic fact that a business entity under normal
“going concern” assumptions means that the entity is in itself the intervention in the systems it is
operating in. Therefore, two major areas of application of the Agile Indicator Board are, first, the
development of logic models for each impact indicator and, second, the development of valuation
factors. The logic models – or also called impact pathway – requires a clear set of assumptions about
causal, correlational, and hypothesized relationships between inputs, activities, and outputs of an entity
and its outcomes and impacts on social and ecological systems. Logic models should be distinguished
from transition pathways. Transition pathways – as used in climate action – are derived from
scientifically grounded reference scenarios towards a pre-defined (near-term and long-term) target.
Those transition pathways for net zero goals – as suggested by the IPCC – can be combined with
sustainable development goals in the form of climate-resilient development pathways. Therefore, logic
models for corporate entities can and should make use of reference scenarios and transition pathways in
their evaluation of interventions.
Generally, valuation factors are user-specific (decision, impacts, “stakeholder” focus, organizational
level, etc.), context-dependent (dependencies, geographic, cultural, etc.), time-bound (accruals-based,
periodic, backward-looking, forward-looking, etc.) and aim to represent a coherent system to measure
stocks and flows. According to the Capitals Coalition, the development of valuation factors is
comprised of several features:

Design principles that follow the logic of auditability pose certain limitations and boundaries on the
usefulness and informativeness. The Transparency Criteria under development by the Value
Commission are intended to incentivize organizations to disclose their assumptions behind constructing
value factors by which they multiply their impact indicators. Draft transparency criteria are

responding to more evidence from academia
and practice about corporate impacts
3. Enabling decision-makers to compare:
different impacts on society, with financial
numbers, and among different companies
and countries.

Sustainability reporting, impact measurement and valuation are interconnected parts of the same
information ecosystem and data value chain. Developers of such methods increasingly position their
work on a "management first" basis rather than "reporting first". This expands the meaning of decision-
usefulness, but challenges remain in aligning this information with financial metrics, adjusting to
diverse company, industry and country profiles and, in turn, providing comprehensive and
comparable sustainability criteria for analyses and decisions.
Consciously adopting this agile development model to ongoing and future efforts in impact
measurement and valuation matters for three reasons. First, standard-setters such as the IFRS ISSB, GRI
GSSB, and EFRAG engage expert networks and other participants in short timeframes. Those situations
afford high flexibility and capacity for collaboration without much prior preparation or team-building.

This can be observed in discussions with practitioners and from the filled agendas and timetables that
often need to be revised in the regulatory and industry working groups. Similar challenges are to be
expected with the announced revision of the GHG Protocol, the Science-based Targets Initiative, the
industry-led Taskforce for Nature-related Financial Disclosures (TNFD), and the Value Balancing
Alliance. Those initiatives engage directly with preparers and users of the information to improve
usability and, therefore, uptake of their outputs.

Applying the corporate indicator framework set out in the Core Indicators requires an assessment of the
uncertainty of the indicators. One might expect that the GCI Core Indicators would mostly fall into
tier 1 indicators because part of the uncertainty assessment has already been made by the UNCTAD

team and the consultative group of experts. We recall that the backlog of tasks for any given sprint
follows directly from the tracking based on the criteria of the different tiers. To include user stories in
the backlog, they need to be broken down into actionable tasks. In employing an agile development
approach, defining indicators as "tasks" in the development process means breaking down their features
into small actionable bits.
One important application is the Transparent Project which we include in the repository of key
performance indicators (appendix A-1). Under the European Green Deal, the Transparent Project
established natural management accounting and valuation principles as a means to mobilize private
sector investment for the green transition. 16  The Transparent Project establish a common language of
impact accounting principles coving environmental KPIs that permit any corporate or financial market
participant to account for its impact performance standardized and comparable, and compatible with
monetization.
Another important application is the IFC Performance Standards that ensure development finance
performs according to the IFC policies. The IFC forms part of the World Bank Group, which invests in
emerging and developing countries while ensuring the performance of these investments. It established
the IFC's Performance Standards, a set of environmental and social guidelines, that the organization
expects its clients to meet the IFC objectives when carrying out their projects. These standards are
designed to ensure that projects funded by the IFC are economically viable, environmentally sound, and
socially beneficial. The Performance Standards cover a wide range of issues and are considered to be
among the most comprehensive sustainability standards for private sector projects.
By conducting a thorough first- and second-order assessment of users based on the criteria above, the
members in a sprint select indicators that promote comparability, controllability, consistent
measurement, suitability for different reporting levels, and effective integration of financial and non-
financial information. This ensures that sustainability reporting provides meaningful insights and
supports informed decision journeying on user profiles. However, this step cannot be completed unless
the purpose of the indicator or valuation factor is clarified, and we propose that this purpose is anchored
in the user needs, as discussed in the following chapter.

III. Information User Profiles and Decision Journeys
4.
How do decision-makers evaluate impacts,
and what information do they need?
This question is at the heart of standard-setting and method development, yet "decision usefulness"
remains an elusive concept. The reference points for the identification of user needs are linked to
external user groups rather than specific users within an organization. The assessment is for reporting
themes as a whole and not for individual indicators or valuation factors. The assessment of whether
themes such as climate or health & safety are decision-useful builds on the reasonable expectation of user
characteristics such as business knowledge and analytical skills. To understand user stories for impact
indicators, developers must identify the needs of information users. The narrower the definition of the
primary users by a standard or methods framework, the more homogenous those user needs become.
Conversely, the broader the definition of uses is, the more diverse their user profiles and decision-making
journeys appear. Currently, it is up to preparers – the corporations themselves – to identify the
information user needs for a specific report within a given conceptual framework. In the following
section, we will outline this approach and provide examples and cases.

Figure 16: General Features of Information User Experience.



Building on those various elements of decision-usefulness, we can derive the core elements of what we
term the user experience of impact measurement and valuation. The general principles described above
are reproduced in many different reporting frameworks in a similar way and sometimes with different
nuances. What they have in common is that they are framed as enhancing the quality of inputs for
information users when they, more accurately, describe the preparer's output. This conceptual
ambiguity becomes clear in the report by the Working Group on Data and Usability of the EU

## Page 22

Sustainable Finance Platform. Their assessment of the usability of the proposed EU Taxonomy
approached the problems from three angles:  Structural, interpretative, and technical issues.17
The core elements of user experience for impact measurement and valuation, thus, are relevance,
presentation, and usability. Analogously to agile development methods, we adapt the idea of user
experience to corporate information features. First, the interpretation and understanding of the
underlying norms of the reporting by the user - e.g. the GHG Protocol for scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions
or GRI 403 for health & safety incidents of employees in their own operations and the supply chain -
determines the relevance.  Second, structural issues - formatting, numbering, naming conventions, the
detailed use of abbreviations and words such as "shall", "may", "could", "would", "should", etc. - are
defined by generally accepted reporting frameworks under (fair) presentation. Thirdly, the context of
the decision-maker builds the core of the usability of corporate
information. Organizational activities such as capital allocation,
product development, sales, investor relations, procurement, etc.
- turning information into action and matching problems and
solutions at regular and random points in the organizational
decision-making process.
The broader definition of users is featured in UNCTAD
Guidance on Core Indicators and the Global Reporting
Initiative (GRI 1). The Guidance on Core Indicators for
Sustainability and SDGs suggests a comprehensive set of
indicators that cover the economic, social, environmental, and
institutional dimensions of sustainable development. According
to the GRI, information users should be enabled to make
"informed assessments and decisions about the organization's
impacts and contribution to sustainable development." Users are
organizations "regardless of size, type, geographic location, or
reporting experience." Stakeholders are not defined. Users
include: society at large, capital providers, government agencies,
and other key stakeholders.18 The IFVI-VBA enlarges the list of
users of impact accounting in even greater detail.19

The IFRS defines users more narrowly. In its first standard, ISSB S1 defines the usefulness of
sustainability-related financial information in terms of the needs of "primary users of general purpose
financial reporting". Accordingly, significant sustainability-related risks and opportunities need to help
decision-makers to assess "enterprise value and decide whether to provide resources to the entity".20
However, guidance from the Conceptual Framework of Financial Reporting mentions potential
investors, lenders and other creditors (1.5). While general-purpose financial reports are "not designed to
show the value of a reporting entity", the reports help primary users to assess the entity's value (1.7).
Those users are expected to "have reasonable knowledge of business and economic activities and who
review and analyze the information diligently" (2.36).21
The IFRS Practice Statement 2 offers further clarification, which spells out a high degree of discretion
on the part of the preparer: General purpose reports cannot meet all specialized and unique information.
Rather, they focus on "common information needs" that an entity identifies the needs shared within
one of three categories: first for investors (existing and potential) and then separately for lenders and
other creditors (all existing and potential). This yields the "total of the information needs", of which
some will be common to all three categories, and others are only specific to  (21-23).22
Relevance and faithful representation are essential principles in this context, as they ensure the provision
of accurate, reliable, and meaningful financial information. Relevance refers to the information's
capacity to influence users' decisions by making a difference in their assessments and evaluations.
Accounting information must be relevant to the needs of users, such as investors, creditors, and other
stakeholders, to be useful for decision-making purposes. On the other hand, faithful representation
entails the depiction of financial information that is complete, neutral, and free from material error or
bias. It is crucial for the information to faithfully represent the economic reality it seeks to portray,
providing a true and fair view of an organization's financial position and performance.
The framework for financial reporting also outlines other qualitative characteristics that enhance the
usefulness and reliability of financial information. Comparability refers to the ability to compare
financial information between different entities or periods. It involves presenting information in a
consistent manner, using similar accounting policies and methods, which allows users to identify
similarities and differences and make meaningful comparisons. Verifiability emphasizes the importance
of evidence and the ability to confirm the accuracy of reported financial information. Verifiable
information is supported by sufficient and reliable evidence, enabling auditors, assurers, regulators, and
other interested parties to assess the reliability and truthfulness of the information presented. Timeliness
highlights the need for financial information to be available in a timely manner. It should be provided

to users promptly to ensure the decision journey. Understandability stresses the need for financial
information to be presented in a clear and concise manner, making it comprehensible to users with
reasonable knowledge and understanding of business and economic activities.
To summarise, the fundamental and enhancing characteristics laid down in the most widely recognized
reporting frameworks should be investigated more systematically and empirically in terms of user
profiles and the decisions they need to make on their user journey.
5.
Applications to Impact Measurement and Valuation
As demonstrated above, user needs are currently assumed as homogenous and not context-specific but
this does premise does not hold in reality. For example, every information user - from investors to
executive directors to customers - is assumed to require the same level of accuracy, comparability, or
relevance for their decisions. Current conceptual frameworks on a "reporting first" approach are missing
the basic premise of "integrated thinking" for decision-usefulness. Different users occupy different
positions along the data value chain, and while the organization as a whole needs a complete picture,
different parts of the organization have different user needs regarding the data and quality.
We, therefore, propose that the concept of information user experience – borrowed from user-centred
design and systems thinking – allows us to determine the utility, preferences, and behaviour of
information to different participants of a specific system. For example, strategic decision-makers might
have a different utility functions for accuracy than operational decision-makers. Pension funds investing
in a real estate portfolio might have different preferences for comparability than private equity investors
acquiring shares in a civil infrastructure project. Behaviourally, different information user groups
process quantitative information in ways that are qualitatively different. How to determine those groups
is, as we argue, not a task individual companies can accomplish alone but it requires collaboration
industry-by-industry and partnerships with policy-makers and civil society organizations. The
qualitative requirements of usability, presentation, and relevance of quantitative information will vary
across organizational contexts from inputs, activities, outputs to outcomes, impacts and valuations.

Figure 18: General Logic Model in Impact Measurement and Valuation.

Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4545204


## Page 25

25
The arguments set out in this report have important implications, as we see in more detail below when
surveying the user definitions and guidance provided by several standard conceptual frameworks. One
consequence is that user needs, even if they are narrowly defined as "investors, creditors, and lenders",
do not specify which users require what type of information along the logic model23 from inputs to
impacts. Sometimes, the first three – inputs, activities and outputs – are described as “value”, “impact”
or “performance” drivers which assume a certain underlying causality. The assumptions about the
systems, scenarios, interventions/entities are fundamental to evaluating the decision-usefulness of
indicators.
Further issues arise from the fact that there is no coherent system for each reporting or impact theme
that records both flows and stocks of the underlying measurement quantum. For example, GHG
emission flows are expressed as an inventory, but this device does not conform with the principles of
double-entry accounting, and, hence, an accrual-based carbon balance sheet framework does not exist
to this date (Jia, 2023). OHS is not even at a point where it can be recorded as flows because the
underlying quantum - human health - cannot be readily counted as a physical material without meeting
concerns about the objectification of humans as resources or capital. Here, some developers of impact
valuation test the proxies of Quality-Adjusted Life Years (Qualys) and Disability-Adjusted Life Years or
productivity as potential candidates for the quantification of "flows" and "stocks" of well-being.
If one follows a more focused user definition - potential and actual investors, lenders and creditors - as
the primary user of general-purpose financial reporting, there is considerable diversity in the user needs
to be based on the different activities and specific organizational users. This is exemplified in a
background study on sustainable finance for the Asian Development Bank.24 The focus of table below
is on information users rather than producers and intermediaries. A full public repository will require
iterations of this list to include user groups from broad categories of government and civil society:
local/indigenous communities, consumers/B-to-C customers, employees/ trade unions, environmental
organizations, social movement groups, faith-based financial institutions, general insurance companies,
development finance institutions, commercial treasury accounts and insurance policyholders, and
consumer finance institutions.
In his report, one key learning from agile development methods is how important it is to separate design
principles (how things work) from normative principles (how things should be). We purposefully
separate information user experience from materiality of accounting information. We argue that while
those concepts are mutually dependent, they follow a markedly different structure, logic, and purpose.
The former is a set of design principles for the development of methodologies, while the latter is a
normative principle in legal and accounting systems. Both originate from different communities of

practice and professional networks that developed different thresholds of significance and standards of
validity and propriety. One may be more conducive to the logic of audibility or verification, and the
other may be more amenable to the logic of due process. The discussion of the conceptual relationship,
tensions, and implications has been the subject of social science studies in accounting and merits further
analysis25 which is outside of this report’s scope.

Key Learnings from the Pilot Sprint
In this pilot sprint, we adopted a broad view of information users that are located within corporations.
In the exploratory stage, we studied three organizations in different sectors and zoomed into five user
information groups. A summary of the findings is listed in Table 3, and the case highlights below.

Novartis' motivation to conduct

dialogue based on our value to
society
2. Enhance decision-making
with additional impact relevant
quantitative insights and
forward-looking impact

3. Meaningfully increase the

financial disclosures to build
trust with the societies we are
operating in

In line with these objectives,

business steering.
Since 2001, the BMW Group
has published sustainable value

had a long tradition of
publishing environmental
reports, disclosing the impact of
its operations on the
environment, including
mitigating measures. However,
since 2005, followed Global
Reporting Initiative (GRI)
standards in its report on
sustainability matters, and since
2008, voluntarily complied with
the highest GRI application
level. The standard was further
raised in 2015 when the General
Assembly of the United Nations
(UN) announced 17 Sustainable
Development Goals (SDGs); the
group identified the SDGs to
which it can make a direct and
thus the greatest possible
contribution with its own
sustainability goals.

Sprint Goal and Outputs
The Global Impact Sprint on Valuation is informed by organizational research, and it is an agile
development model piloted in collaboration with the University of Oxford Said Business School, Hong
Kong University of Science and Technology Business School, and the Value Balancing Alliance. The
overarching goal of this first Global Impact Sprint was to pilot the sprint model itself and, thus,
formalize and refine its process, resources, and usefulness for future sprints.
While the substantive outputs are important, the primary focus was to provide several learning
opportunities for the students:  a) working in an agile environment, b) collaborating across different
time zones and in a diverse team, c) learning from leading experts and a variety of corporations in the
field of impact measurement and valuation.

Figure 19: Goals of Pilot Sprint 2023.


The pilot sprint provides the following outputs:
● Presentations and work-in-progress from the Sprint Teams based on the workbook
● Presentations and discussion notes from workshop days and interview calls
● Online Scrum-Kanban Board to learn about the Sprint Model and manage their own sprint
● "Live" collection of materials on sustainability reporting, impact measurement, valuation,
management
● Sprint Workbook with tools and guidance for running the sprint

Those outputs are made freely available online and regularly updated subject to internal review.

Key Learnings from the Pilot Sprint
Our sprint teams were students selected from the two universities, and they had little or no prior
knowledge about the complex topic of impact valuation. The pilot sprint has benefitted from the
enthusiastic support from its supporting organizations and representatives from companies such as
Novartis, Holcim, BMW, and VW. Students were responsible for breaking down the goals into specific
tasks and providing a final presentation using the sprint workbook. Both student teams were given a
checklist with 19 standard and method documents from which they had to make a selection for GHG
and OHS indicators and valuation factors to achieve sprint goal 1. They were also given another checklist
containing five different user groups from which they had to choose two industries and three user
groups.

The pilot sprint simulated many of the conditions that are also encountered in practice, which was part
of the learning experience:
● Project organizations deal with complex systems with uncertainty about causal relationships
or policy objectives.
● Project teams cannot rely on traditional waterfall project management and clear instructions
on stages of work because the sprint goal deals with complex systems with uncertainty about
causal relationships or policy objectives.
● Projects with high uncertainty require the engagement of innovative development team
members. However, it is often difficult to assemble the required depth and breadth of
interdisciplinary knowledge and skills.
● Limited financial budgets, time, and personnel reduce organizational slack26 needed to
innovate with comprehensive databases, technology and infrastructure.
Our sprint teams addressed the sprint goals under a high degree of self-organization, limited instructions,
and collaboration across sprint teams in different time zones through virtual connection. Since the teams
had not been exposed to agile development models prior to the sprint, they spent a significant
proportion of time learning on the job. The two sprint teams decided independently to focus on GHG
emissions and valuation factors. They opted to coordinate their work and ensured that they cover
different industries and user groups.

minimum for the operational tasks at hand and, in turn, gives space for learning and creativity.

Next steps
To utilize sprints as an agile methodology for collaborative research with practitioners and in university
education, key learnings relate to prioritization, backlog task management, and refining sprint resources.
The next round - an advanced Global Impact Sprint – may also need to take all feedback from
participants and contributors of the pilot into account. We will also take on board other instruments,
such as the Agile Manifesto.27 For the future study of decision-usefulness of accounting information,
we draw attention to the following tasks:

V. Conclusion
The recent use of “agile”-type methods by businesses and standard developers marks a new phase in the
growth of new accounting practices. The features of rapidly iterating feedback loops and highly specific
technical expertise distinguish themselves from the due process standards by traditional institutions
involved in the making of policies, laws, and standards over the last two centuries.
This report provides an analysis of those new collaboration methods used by different organizations in
the field of impact valuation and sustainability reporting. We are building on previous work that
explored agile development methods in the context of sustainable development and provide insights
from a pilot sprint ran by the autors themselves.
To advance scientific and practical knowledge on the decision-usefulness of social-environmental
accounting data, we propose to shift attention to information user behaviours in the context of
organizational and institutional processes. Future work in this area at the intersection of organization,
accounting, and sociolegal studies could critique, inspire, complement, and triangulate existing
economic models of user preferences in sustainable investing. A first step requires the study of
commonalities, differences, ambiguities, and other properties of information user behaviour
investigated through rigorous social science methods.
In the spirit of “engaged scholarship”, the unpacking of decision-usefulness is intended to help
organizations to move from reporting to decision-making that yield changes in real terms. As
demonstrated in this report, the sprint method represents a collaboration method that moves beyond
researcher and research subject. The sprint model serves three purposes: first, the model is a discursive-
rhetorical tool for sensemaking in an area of modern organization where processes of rationalization and
pressures for justification often lead to “reporting first” approaches that obfuscates or confuses action;
second, as a collaborative research method to bridge between epistemic communities of professional
practice whose different norms, expectations, and motivations often create time inconsistencies and
other potential barriers for effective collaboration; third, the sprint synchronizes times of actors that are
distributed across geographies, jurisdictions, economic sectors, professional fields, scientitic disciplines,
and organizational levels.
From a policy and practice perspective, agile collaboration models are one of many ways to
understanding information user profiles and decision journeys of different organizational stakeholders
aides strategic planning and risk management. From a scientific perspective, those research subjects are
participants in socio-technical and ecological systems whose dramatic developments over the last two
centuries have given rise to new evaluative infrastructures.
