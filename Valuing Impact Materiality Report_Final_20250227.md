1 Introduction
In the year 2022, the European Parliament and the Council enacted the Corporate
Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD), and it has been in force since 2023.1 Developed
over the course of over 15 years, the CSRD amended a directive from the year 2013. It is
Legal Act of the European Union and the basis for robust and comprehensive sustainability
reporting standards aligned with the objectives of the European Green Deal and other policies.
It also aligns with other international standards in order to establish interoperability and
connectivity. 2  The resulting sustainability reporting standards (ESRS) are based on this
primary legislation. Beyond the EU, several developments (e.g., IFRS ISSB S1 and S2, US
SEC Climate Disclosures, PBOC Basic Standards) aim at enabling companies to integrate
sustainability into their activities by means of consistent and comparable reporting and
assurance.
At the heart of the CSRD framework lies the
materiality assessment, designed to guide
companies in understanding and addressing
their environmental, social, and governance
impacts.3 It requires companies to disclose
material
sustainability
matters—
encompassing general, topical, and sector-
specific issues—to achieve transparency
consistent with the objectives of the CSRD.4
The CSRD and its delegated acts leave it at
the discretion of companies to define
materiality thresholds.

European Green Deal (11 Dec 2019) revises non-financial reporting (Directive 2013/34/EU) to make the
EU climate-neutral by 2050, promoting resource-efficient, sustainable, and inclusive transitions,
protecting natural capital and health (Regulation (EU) 2021/1119). Commission’s ‘Action Plan on
Financing Sustainable Growth’ (8 Mar 2018) redirects capital to sustainable investments, manages
environmental risks, and fosters transparency, with comparable sustainability disclosures supporting
these goals (Regulation (EU) 2019/2088). ‘EU Biodiversity Strategy for 2030’ (20 May 2020) aims to
restore ecosystems globally by 2050, protecting biodiversity essential for sustainability. Regulations like
Regulation (EU) 2020/852 on sustainable economic activities, Regulation (EU) 2019/2089 on IMPACT
disclosures, and others address impact risks and financial market transparency, reducing greenwashing.
EU aligns with global frameworks like the SDGs (2030 Agenda) and the Paris Agreement (2015),
ensuring EU policies support global sustainability goals.

What is impact valuation?
“The role of monetary valuation is to translate
those changes in well-being into monetary
terms to reflect the value of the impact to
affected stakeholders.” (IFVI, GM2, par. 58).
How does it relate to impact accounting
and measurement?
The system of accounting for impacts
(impact accounting) depends on methods of
measurement and modeling of impact drivers
(inputs, activities, outputs). Impact valuation
is the mathematical operation of
monetization on specific impact drivers in a
denominated currency unit.
What is Valuing Impact Materiality?
Valuing Impact Materiality is the approach to
assessing the materiality of topics based on
their impacts on local society. It measures
the degree of change in societal well-being
because of a company’s activities.

Balancing Alliance enhanced the decision-usefulness of their sustainability reporting,5 and
most recently by connecting the CSRD to impact accounting and valuation. This effort was
highlighted in Deloitte’s paper on double materiality assessment and KPMG’s publication for
the World Economic Forum. 6  Additionally, service providers—WifOR Institute and GIST
Impact—have contributed to increasing transparency by publishing their valuation factor
matrix, including valuation techniques and application guidance.7 Valuing Impact and RGS
further contributed by publishing their valuation methodology,8 while the IFVI published their
comprehensive set of value factors.9
Under any policy scenario of ESRS implementation, the CSRD marks a paradigm shift from
GDP-focused growth towards a model of inclusive wealth that accounts for natural, human,
produced, and other capitals.10 To establish a global methodology, IFVI and VBA have worked
to standardize impact accounting through a structured process, starting with greenhouse gas
(GHG) emissions and adequate wages.11 The open-source value factors, accessible impact
accounting methodologies, and advanced tools they’ve created make sustainability reporting
and assurance more efficient and reliable.

As illustrated in Figure 1, impact materiality encompasses the effects of corporate activities on
social and environmental systems, along with their impact drivers (inputs, activities, outputs).
Concepts like ‘true profit’ and ‘just profit’ promote sustainable practices, improve transparency,
and foster impact-driven growth by aligning financial success with societal and environmental
value.
As awareness grows around the interdependencies between business, civil society, and the
environment, shareholders increasingly emphasize purpose-driven strategies. This shift
amplifies stakeholder demands to reinforce corporate responsibility through due diligence
based on double materiality.12 In turn, regulations such as the EU's CSRD and SFDR, as well
as IFRS and SEC frameworks are driving companies toward greater accountability and
sustainability in their operations.
2  Valuing Impact Materiality
2.1 Impact Valuation: An Information User Experience View
Assessing the materiality of information hinges on the notion of a threshold: a critical point at
which information is designated as relevant and significant for a specific group of information
users—in essence, information that matters for a given set of decisions. The qualitative
features that enhance the information user experience across various reporting frameworks,
including the ESRS (as the delegated act to the CSRD), can be distilled into three key
dimensions:
•
Relevance: The alignment of potential decision outcomes with the preferences of information
users.
•
Usability: The context-, behavior-, and preference-based information gain experienced by
users.
•
Presentation: The format and structure in which relevant and usable information is conveyed
to users.
For information users relying on thresholds and benchmarks under the CSRD, two key
features determine the usability of such thresholds: comparability and specificity of the
information provided.
The double materiality of information introduces a nuanced variation, addressing both the
impacts and the dependencies within a defined time horizon:
•
Financial materiality -– encompasses the effects of social and environmental systems on a
corporate entity
•
Impact materiality – highlights the effects of the corporate entity on social and environmental
systems.

Impact valuation serves as a precursor or input to the (double) materiality assessment process.
It does not, on its own, define materiality. Instead, it aids information users, both the preparer
entity and its various stakeholders, by enhancing comparability across regulatory, regional,
industry, and absolute thresholds. As a preliminary step in the process, impact valuation
translates reported and estimated ESRS data points into (potential and actual) impacts, in
monetary terms. This enables companies to identify and monitor material topics along their
value chain and undertake necessary interventions to achieve their targets.
Notably, both the ESRS and ISSB frameworks leave the definition of thresholds to the
discretion of reporting entities and provide limited guidance or details in their standards and
accompanying documents.13
Impact valuation captures both positive and negative impacts, providing valuable insights for
the application of various thresholds and benchmarks. It complements the materiality
assessment process by simplifying analysis, reducing costs, supporting global value chain
mapping, and filtering out non-material issues through Environmentally Extended Input-Output
(EEIO) approaches. Thus, to ensure a comprehensive assessment of impact materiality, a
hybrid approach combining data-driven impact valuation and stakeholder engagement is
recommended.

2.2 Deﬁnition of Materiality Thresholds and Benchmarks
A threshold for impact materiality represents the point at which the negative or positive
impacts are considered relevant and significant from the perspective of information
users.
Double materiality underpins the identification of thresholds and benchmarks by requiring
companies to evaluate sustainability issues through two lenses:14 financial materiality, which
focuses on risks and opportunities affecting financial performance, and impact materiality,
which considers the broader social and environmental consequences of corporate activities.15
2.2.1 Threshold
More generally, a threshold is a point at which a certain reaction occurs, or a consequence is
triggered within a system. The construction of thresholds involves three key elements:
•
Reference system: A system in which the whole and its parts interact dynamically—naturally
and/or through human intervention.
•
Limit: A critical quantity of flow or stock within the reference system and/or a logical
conclusion derived from qualitative criteria.
•
Reaction: A response triggered by reaching the defined limit, which may be naturally
occurring and/or of human design for a specific user (e.g., dose-response).
Thresholds are dynamic, evolving with changes in the system, and assume a normal
distribution of numerical values. Construction and application of thresholds requires a mix of
calculation and judgement. As social and ecological systems change, thresholds may shift due
to alterations, e.g., in transition risks or physical risks. Such shifts could result from changes
at sensitive intervention points, such as tightening regulatory standards or changing societal
expectations, or the breaching of planetary boundaries and surpassing of tipping points.
For the CSRD, this means: The reference system is determined by several elements, incl. the
structure and nature of the specific impact driver, the causal relationships of stocks and flows
in social-environmental systems as well as the attribution of impacts (logic model), the context
of various system levels and geographic scopes (the ‘system boundary’), and the calculability
of impact drivers as inputs, activities, and outputs (measurement units). Limits are decision
weights that are dependent on the information user experience (incl. their behavior, goals,
preferences, context, etc.). Reactions are the potential outcomes of decisions made by
information users (e.g., investors and various stakeholders); examples include investor
decisions to buy, hold, sell, engage.

2.2.2 Benchmark
A benchmark for impact materiality is a reference point for evaluating a company’s
sustainability performance relative to a specific topic, industry, region, or universe.
A benchmark is a static measure relative to a sample within the reference system. It must be
periodically adjusted based on the underlying reference index. The numerical outputs
represent averages applicable to a specific part of the reference system (sample distributions).
Benchmarks alone do not define materiality thresholds, as they primarily serve as comparative
reference points. However, when combined with additional contextual measures—such as
regulatory limits, scientific thresholds, or sector-specific risk adjustments—they may serve as
a proxy for setting thresholds, helping to determine materiality in sustainability assessments.

2.3 Issues for Policy and Practice
Thresholds and benchmarks can interact in different ways:
•
Benchmarks shaping thresholds: Benchmarks can influence normative expectations and
perceptions of appropriateness. As used widely by market participants, benchmark methods
may acquire the quality of standard-like norms, which can, in turn, inform the development of
thresholds.
•
Thresholds shaping benchmarks: Thresholds can be used as standardized reference
points, as limits for negative impacts (e.g., harm reduction), or as indicators of additionality for
positive impacts.
Generally speaking, issues of science-based causality or attribution play a critical role in
qualifying the relationship between benchmarks and thresholds. Benchmarks can form the
basis for constructing indices that track a firm’s performance relative to peer groups within
thematic categories. While benchmarks can approximate thresholds, they must be used with
caution. Industry averages may reflect past performance rather than forward-looking
sustainability requirements, and sector-based benchmarks may not account for emerging risks
or absolute planetary limits. Therefore, benchmarks should be contextualized with regulatory
guidance, scientific findings, or stakeholder priorities to ensure thresholds remain meaningful.
In other words, benchmarks may be used as thresholds in materiality assessment—however,
challenges remain, particularly in determining the meaning of positive impacts from the
information user perspective, rather than assuming industry averages as natural thresholds.
Impact valuation is essential for identifying positive and negative impacts, risks, and
opportunities (IRO) of a company’s business activities and value chain, as well as defining
time horizons for materiality assessments. In preparing for the impact materiality process,
companies describe the IROs with sufficient granularity to encompass impacts from the
business perspective (disaggregated if necessary), including separate valuations for potential
and actual impacts, positive and negative impacts, and impacts within companies’ own
operations versus those in the value chain.16
Environmental impacts are typically assessed prior to mitigation, permitting gross valuations
of potential impacts and net valuations of actual impacts, and providing a clearer
understanding of net impacts in the materiality analysis.17 ESRS sustainability matters provide
a starting point, and companies are required to identify entity-specific topics that go beyond
generic assessments. Note that specific thematic standards may impose additional
requirements as well.

Consistent impact materiality processes and comparable valuation techniques enable
companies to assess material positive and negative impacts. This includes tracking impact
performance data points not expressly mandated for disclosure under ESRS, but which
nonetheless support a better understanding of impact trajectories within the CSRD framework.
Independent advisors can play a role in encouraging standardized metrics for impact
measurement, improving the consistency of data collection and reporting over time to enable
meaningful comparisons across reporting periods and extending beyond own operations to
value chain stages and industries. Early planning for the impact materiality process beyond
the first reporting period ensures control over impact and gap assessments while benefiting
from streamlined procedures and economies of scale. Audits further strengthen this process
through increased alignment, enhanced comparability, credibility, and stakeholder trust in
reported information. Material impacts should be evaluated from the stakeholder’s perspective,
factoring in the scale, scope, and irremediability of impacts across own operations and the
value chain and considering that materiality thresholds may require adjustment over time to
reflect changing circumstances.
3 Methods to Establish Thresholds and
Benchmarks
3.1 Overview: from Impact Assessment to Valuation
In this section, we provide a first-of-its-kind evaluation of approaches to thresholds and
benchmarks for double materiality assessment (DMA) with and without impact valuation.
Today’s impacts may evolve into tomorrow’s risks and opportunities, given the interconnection
between impact, dependency, risk, and opportunities.18 Severity, based on scale, scope, and
irremediability, defines the threshold for actual negative material impacts, while scale and
scope apply to actual positive material impacts. Likelihood is considered for negative and
positive potential impacts.19 When assessing potential adverse human rights impacts, severity
should be prioritized over likelihood to ensure accurate and meaningful evaluations.
Companies retain the discretion to define thresholds within legal constraints.20

For the application of thresholds under the CSRD,21 the following steps are important: 1)
Identification and application of threshold approach and methodology; 2) Specification of
thresholds to the entity and its context; 3) Operationalization using the applied thresholds.
First, preparers identify the thresholds and how they are applied, i.e., their methodology
(identification and application). The delegated acts point at robust, context-specific
methodologies, such as sectoral benchmarks, scientific targets (e.g., SBTi for climate), and
international frameworks (e.g., SDGs).22 It is helpful to distinguish between the reference
system, the limits, and the reaction described in 2.2.1 above. This is reflected in the delegated
act, where thresholds need to be identified, and the respective methodology.23
Second, those thresholds need to be—whenever possible—entity-specific. Entity-specific
here means that the thresholds are a function of measured or modelled data from specific
operations and locations of the company and its value chain. The method of data collection
and analysis, as well as the sources of thresholds, should be intelligible. According to the
delegated acts, the companies need to clarify whether or not the thresholds are entity-specific
and, if so, how they were determined.24 Entity-specificity and operationalization of general and
topical thresholds cover impacts from unique own operations, value chains, and geographic
contexts of the reporting entity.25
Third, entities follow their corporate policies when they implement thresholds as part of
organizational practices. If preparers use such thresholds as described above, they will have
some kind of organizational structure which allocates responsibility to respect the identified
thresholds from the information user perspective. To describe this structure, the model of
information user experience is useful, which follows the features described in 2.1 above. The
delegated acts will have some guidance for entities to explain how responsibility for respecting
identified (ecological) thresholds is allocated in the undertaking.26 An entity may show how
assurance and responsibility are allocated across functions and divisions, including in its
enterprise risk management system, compliance, strategy, and innovation processes.27
As shown in Figure 2 below, impact materiality assessments must meet the usability criteria
of entity-specificity and comparability. Thus, specificity on the x-axis means that approaches
and methods provide materiality thresholds that are specific to the context and business

model of the corporate entity. Comparability on the y-axis means that approaches and
methods provide materiality thresholds that are comparable among different corporate
entities and against external performance benchmarks.
This categorization results in four types of threshold methods:

Figure 2: Usability matrix for materiality threshold methods (adapted from West and Euler, 2023).

This evaluation framework of thresholds corresponds to the CSRD’s delegated act
requirements regarding: a) whether the thresholds are identified, and the methodology used
to identify such thresholds; b) whether or not the thresholds are entity-specific and, if so, how
they were determined; and (c) how responsibility for respecting identified ecological
thresholds is allocated in the undertaking.28 The examples used above are explained in
section 3.2 below,  including A.I) Classification-based/Cross-sector thresholds, C.III) Target-
based/Corporate pathways, B.I) System-based/Local and regional boundaries, and B.II)
System-based/Planetary boundaries. Further mapping of detailed methods is on-going work-
in-progress.
Advancing from Type 1 to Type 4 assessments facilitates an increasingly higher degree of
usability as a function of entity-specificity and comparability. In turn, this leads to a broader

and more consistent understanding of impact materiality from the information user’s
perspective.29
The role of impact accounting is clear when it comes to optimization between entity-specificity
and comparability. Type 4 assessments, through scoring, rating, and valuation of measured
impacts, represent the highest degree of usability in terms of entity-specificity and
comparability. But regardless of what assessment type companies use, they need to
demonstrate how severity and likelihood are determined.30 ESRS data points are sourced
through qualitative, quantitative, or mixed methods, on the impacts of the businesses’ own
operations and their impacts within the company and its value chain.31 In particular, impact
accounting supports performance assessment along defined trajectories between material
negative and material positive impacts. The process provides a complete picture of material
sustainability issues. Usability is prioritized through a user-centric approach that delivers
decision-useful information for managers, investors, and communities, enabling them to
understand the company’s business model, stakeholder relationships, context, and value
chain. Complementing qualitative stakeholder engagement with quantitative impact
assessment reduces subjectivity and bias, increases consistency, comparability, efficiency as
well as decision-usefulness in sustainability reporting.

Type 4 (T4) – Consolidated Assessment and Measurement of
Impact Drivers relative to the Entity and a Reference Framework:
T4 assessments provide a robust basis for setting thresholds using
companies’ data management structure and a sector or cross-sector
data universe as benchmarks. Thresholds methods are based on
transparent data and aligned with topical, universal, regional, or
industrial benchmarks. Thresholds are weighted, rated, or monetized
across sectors, industries, and regions. T4 assessments are rated as
high both in terms of comparability and specificity.
Type 1 (T1) – Assessment of Policy Goals and
Shortlisting of Impact Topics: T1 assessments for
initial, qualitative determination of materiality are
based on expert assessment. The threshold is set by
the expert. Methods in this category are rated as low
regarding comparability and low in terms of entity
specificity.
Type 2 (T2) – Disaggregated Assessment and
Measurement of Impact Drivers relative to the
Entity: T2 assessments introduce a quantitative and
entity-specific information approach which can be
operationalized
with
the
professional
implementation of measurement methods. T2
impact valuation uses thresholds based on impact
drivers to evaluate materiality across relevant
sustainability topics, including environmental and
social factors. However, disaggregated measures
are highly specific to the entity and—on their own—
of limited use for external information users.
Methods in this category are rated as high in terms
of entity specificity and low in terms of comparability.
Type 3 (T3) – Aggregated Assessment and
Measurement of Impact Drivers relative to a
Reference Framework: T3 assessments provide
quantitative assessments based on historical or
sectoral data or cross-sectoral data. Information
gathering is methodology-based or data-driven, but
the data goes beyond the specific context. Methods
in this category are rated high in terms of
comparability and low in terms of entity specificity.

3.2 Speciﬁc Approaches for Thresholds and Benchmarks
This section provides various examples of thresholds of corporate impacts that can be applied
in specific contexts, both with and without publicly available benchmarks. 32 Many of the
approaches build on each other and are not mutually exclusive. They may have different
emphases and change over time, making it challenging to delineate specific methodologies.
Therefore, this section provides an overview
of approaches and a non-exhaustive list of
examples focused on materiality assessment
under CSRD from a usability perspective: i.e.,
how thresholds are identified and how
methodologies are used. As we advance, this
work will help us better understand what is
required in order to develop and apply
thresholds and how to enhance the usability
of relevant norms and reporting data for
corporate decision making.

A) Classification-based
In classification-based approaches, thresholds are derived from cross-sectoral or topical and
sector-specific reference points. They may refer to other classification systems’ business
activities. For sustainability activities, those may be the EU Taxonomy (e.g., DNSH and
specific thresholds in technical screening criteria). For economic activities, those may be
generally used industry classifications by data, benchmark, and ratings providers or public
agencies.
A.I) Cross-Sector Thresholds and Benchmarks
How thresholds are identified: As a classification-based approach, thresholds are derived
from databases focused around topics and impact drivers that span different sectors (the
‘universe’). Various information sources include measured, reported, estimated, and modelled
information, data from industry benchmarks, peer comparisons, and other external reference
points. Cross-sector thresholds and benchmarks are drawn from systems based on scoring,

32
See https://github.com/Greenings/transitionvaluation
Technical Note
Thresholds are impact driver-specific and
are derived from biophysical and/or socio-
economic models. In some cases,
thresholds of impact have been established
scientifically and mandated by law. In other
cases, thresholds may be proposed or used
in one context but may not be
operationalizable in another context. Some
are internationally recognized, and others
are only nationally applicable. Some drivers
and impacts do not occur in the same
location. In the same way, some risks are
not spatially or temporally bounded. Some
thresholds are set at the location of the
input, activity, and/or output, and others at
the location of impact.

15
rating, or valuation methodologies. Topical standards may also refer to science-based targets
and trajectories that consider sector-specific contexts.33
How methodologies are used: The specific methodology for all these different systems is
key to deriving suitable T3 or T4 thresholds. In the example below, thresholds are identified
following an impact valuation methodology. The thresholds relate to the industry of the specific
entity. The thresholds are impact intensities for high, median, and low impacts.
Using Airbus as an example, the snapshots below show the materiality of CSRD ESRS E5:
Waste Generation, with scores based on the impacts of its reported hazardous and non-
hazardous waste disposal. These figures are processed through GIST Impact’s Impact
Valuation Engine 34 , which quantifies science-based, location-specific impacts of Airbus’s
waste generation practices. CSRD scores are determined by comparing Airbus's impact
valuation numbers to sector and company thresholds, ensuring both absolute impact and
sector relevance.

data-backed approach. The platform generates CSRD-aligned double materiality scores for over 16,000
globally listed companies, using impact valuation and sector and peer benchmarks as thresholds. These
scores are built on publicly reported sustainability data by listed companies, covering all European stock
indices, ensuring full traceability to data sources and audit readiness.

A.II) Sectoral Thresholds and Benchmarks
How thresholds are identified: ESRS refers to topic-specific applications that permit sector-
and industry-based comparisons based on the specific topic. These contexts can relate to
sector-based benchmarks focused on industry-specific sustainability issues to align with
norms and enable peer comparisons. In particular, where impact is specific to regions or
demographics, companies are encouraged (but not required) to provide additional information
based on accessible methodologies that permit peer-based thresholds to compare companies’
performance against competitors. 36  Sectoral thresholds are also dependent on industry
classification and a number of assumptions around the common characterization of impacts
in that sector. However, such thresholds may be insufficient on their own. They need to make
transparent whether they represent a relative best-in-class or state-of-the-art approach.
Depending on the type of ambition and reference point, those benchmarks yield different
results and are more (or less) useful for specific information users.
How methodologies are used: Sector benchmarks, such as those from the World
Benchmarking Alliance (WBA) aligned to the SDGs, evaluate both positive and negative
effects. They can stand as type 4 thresholds providing entity-specific assessment and
comparability of assessments. Companies can set thresholds using WBA benchmarks,
including defined metrics for each SDG, assess their performance against these standards,
and prioritize actions in critical areas.37 The WifOR benchmarks show intensities per average
sector and country, which serve as a basis to determine if a company’s performance lies below
or above the suggested intensity average.

One possibility is to set a threshold aligned to the ‘percentage of highest impact’ method. Here,
materiality thresholds are based on the relative significance of an impact compared to the
highest impact identified. This involves setting the highest impact as the 100% level and
establishing percentage-based thresholds (e.g., <5% immaterial; >10% material). While this
approach prioritizes actual impacts and allows for the identification of non-financially
significant impact issues, it can be problematic due to threshold shifts. If the highest impact is
reduced, the entire scale shifts, potentially leading to previously immaterial issues becoming
material without any actual increase in their impact.
Another option, in financial accounting and auditing, is to set a materiality threshold using a
percentage of a base level, such as net income. This method suggests using a 5-10% range,
where amounts less than 5% are considered immaterial and those above 10% material—and
those in between require discretion.
ITB suggests targets based on various categories. The suggested threshold for annual
reduction in CO2e intensity is set at 7% commencing from 2023, in addition to other criteria.

B) System-based
B.I) Local and Regional Boundaries
How thresholds are identified: Ecology-based thresholds are grounded in scientifically
recognized ecological limits to prevent significant environmental damage. Companies align
with ecological limits for areas such as emissions budgets, water consumption, pollution, and
biodiversity, often using frameworks. This ensures that impacts approaching or exceeding
these thresholds are considered material.38 This approach covers the critical environmental
issues that are location-specific, e.g., water stress, carbon sequestration, and water demand.
Here, expertise is required to identify and operationalize the thresholds, which can lead to
stricter assessments while complementing other sustainability matters.39
How methodologies are used: The thresholds and the respective methodology refer to the
IUCN Red List or the WWF Water and Biodiversity Risk Filter. These thresholds are based on
the listed species and require the expertise of the individual applying them to the company.
Responsibilities are aligned with the established compliance structure. IUCN Red List and
WWF Water and Biodiversity Risk Filter-specific target setting. ESRS requires a site- or asset-

20
specific understanding of material impacts, risks, and opportunities. 40  Depending on the
available site-specific information, the threshold is either a type 2 or type 3 threshold.
B. II) Planetary Boundaries
How thresholds are identified: The planetary boundaries framework identifies nine critical
earth system processes that regulate the stability and resilience of the planet.41 Exceeding
these boundaries could lead to irreversible environmental changes (‘tipping points’),
threatening the conditions that have allowed human societies to thrive. Economic damages
have been extensively reported, with their valuation reflecting the chosen economic model for
addressing environmental constraints and quantifying the depletion of natural capital in
monetary terms.42 To set thresholds aligned with the tipping points of planetary boundaries,
companies must identify planetary boundaries, evaluate impacts, and establish region- and
sector-specific limits. These boundaries may offer a benchmark for companies to set
thresholds for their operations but operationalizing beyond qualitative assessment requires
robust data.
How methodologies are used: Companies can integrate planetary boundaries into
sustainability reporting as data becomes available. It anchors assessments to scientific limits
promoting long-term sustainability and avoiding irreversible damage. The threshold is derived
from planetary boundary models and identifies the key components relevant to setting the
threshold. Experts are required to undertake additional work to translate the model into an
operationalized threshold, either through more specific models or qualitative assessments.
Responsibilities are aligned with the general accountability framework. Planetary boundaries
are type 1 per se, their focus on qualitative mapping policy goals and shortlisting impact topics
with experts to include understanding a corporations’ plan and capacity to adapt its strategy
and business model in alignment with tipping points, biosphere integrity and land-system
change.43

B. III) Social-Ecological Boundaries
How thresholds are identified: The social-ecological approach sets thresholds by identifying
social and ecological boundaries relevant to a business’s operations in two categories: The
first represents the foundations necessary for production (e.g., living wages, healthcare,
education) and the second represents ecological ceilings (e.g., climate change, biodiversity,
water scarcity). Companies assess their performance relative to these boundaries. Inclusive
wealth concepts,44 or the Doughnut concept,45 serve as a guide for decisions to increase
positive impacts on value creation, social cohesion, and respect for planetary limits. The
approach may initially serve operational as a qualitative assessment.
How methodologies are used: Companies can address data gaps, adopt appropriate
methodologies, simplify complexities, and manage the costs to integrate them into
benchmarks and thresholds across entire value chains. The model requires additional steps
to identify thresholds or select methodologies, as the doughnut, on its own, cannot be
operationalized for threshold setting for business.

### C)

Scenario-based
Scenario-based thresholds define the targets to be achieved under specific scenarios. For
example, transition pathways to net zero emissions should align with reference scenarios with
these reference scenarios, drawing on environmental contexts outlined in IPCC reports, or
providing very specific guidance, for example, from the International Energy Agency (IEA).

22
C. I) Reference Scenario-based
How thresholds are identified: Companies can utilize scenarios based on science from
international reports, e.g., IPCC 1.5°C, Kunming-Montreal Framework, to set targets and
assess their operations’ actual and potential impacts. These scenarios establish baselines that
are aligned with global sustainability goals.
How methodologies
are
used:
Generally, reference
scenarios require
further
operationalization to enhance entity-specificity and comparability. IPCC RCP and SSP-based
scenarios per se are the basis for a type 1 threshold for a company that needs additional
qualitative assessment. Such models can stand as a type 4 threshold if a central bank
implements them by integrating additional valuation throughout their portfolio, such as in stress
tests.46
C. II) Interpretative Scenarios
How thresholds are identified: Companies may align their reference scenarios with
configurations provided by IEA and similar institutions that offer sector specific guidance.
How methodologies are used: These scenarios can reflect configurations used in other
models such as integrated assessment models (IAMs).47 IEA Net Zero sector pathways can
qualify as a type 3 threshold offering the possibly for industry-specific comparison. Another
interpretative scenario is NGFS, which can be used by regulators and firms in the financial
sector. The link between targets and scenarios requires further operationalization. This is
needed to ensure entity-specificity and comparability.
C. III) Corporate Pathways
How thresholds are identified: The Transition Pathways Initiative (TPI) evaluates corporate
pathways for decarbonization, focusing on how companies in high-emission sectors are
managing the transition to a low-carbon economy. TPI uses management quality, which tracks
governance practices on climate risks, and carbon performance, which measures emissions
reductions against sector-specific benchmarks aligned with the Paris Agreement. TPI’s
framework supports investors in assessing progress towards net-zero targets and
incorporates generally accepted data.
How methodologies are used: The sectoral decarbonization approach allows for type 3 and
4 thresholds. Moreover, carbon prices are context-specific, based on accessible
methodologies aligned with science-based trajectories, and qualify as type 4.48 This includes

detailing calculation methodologies, critical assumptions, and alignment with science-based
carbon pricing trajectories. The thresholds may qualify as type 3 if sector-specific or cross-
sector emission pathways compatible with a 1.5°C target are used as reference points for
assessing GHG reduction targets across Scopes 1, 2, and 3.49
D) Target-based
D. I) SDG Targets
How thresholds are identified: SDGs provide a framework as a basis to set environmental,
social, and policy goals. Goals provide a common direction for corporates and policy makers,
as opposed to more precise targets. Companies may steer operations towards SDGs following
the 169 targets that can adapted to local indicators at national or regional levels.50
How methodologies are used: The SDGs per se require qualitative analysis to be
incorporated in the assessment. This approach relates to type 1 thresholds. It is important to
note that the UN Statistics Division follows an SDG indicator framework, which classifies the
indicator underlying each goal and target. For operationalization, companies may relate their
contributions to the targets and may use the data from national statistics offices or public
databases, e.g., the various SDG trackers.51
D. II) Science-based Targets
How thresholds are identified: Companies can align with frameworks like the Science-
Based Targets initiative (SBTi), Science-Based Targets Initiative for Nature (SBTN), and
Nature Positive Initiative to set environmental targets by addressing ecosystem degradation,
resource efficiency, and biodiversity restoration. Industry-specific targets such as water use
reduction, zero deforestation, and sustainable supply chains can be established to support
global efforts to reverse biodiversity loss.52 The targets are set in relation to a specific baseline
and can take the following form:
-
Absolute Targets – Companies align their reporting to absolute reporting generally
required under topical-specific information.
-
Relative and Intensity Targets – Companies enhance the comparability of KPI-based
thresholds by adjusting for operational size and scale, expressed as intensity, and set
targets for operational efficiency and relative impacts.

How methodologies are used: The ESRS provide discretion to companies to use experts to
set site-specific thresholds and methodologies and assign responsibilities accordingly. For
example, ESRS E2, Appendix A, AR 15: “Where relevant to achieve its pollution-related policy
objectives and targets, the undertaking may provide information on site-level action plans.”
Or, ESRS E2, Appendix A, AR 18: “Where relevant to support the policies it has adopted, the
undertaking may provide information on the targets set at site level.” The Science-Based
Targets Initiative for Nature (SBTN) and similar frameworks, which use ecological thresholds
at local, national, or global levels, qualify as type 3 thresholds. 53  These targets require
measurable, time-bound data, often sector-specific trajectories, and must disclose absolute or
intensity values, allowing for progress tracking against defined benchmarks.54 The ESRS may
further include target setting for current and future years.

E) Norm-based
How thresholds are identified: Norm-based thresholds are public or private norms for
corporate sustainability performance on specific impact drivers. 55  Examples for negative
impact thresholds are legal limits to air, water, and land pollution; food and product safety such
as thresholds of toxins; and pollution permits and certificates in regulatory trading schemes
and voluntary carbon markets. Examples of positive impacts certificate of origins for renewable
energy sources.
How methodologies are used: The EU uses benchmarks under the Best Available
Techniques (BAT) reference documents for agro-industrial activities to develop thresholds.
This includes the emission levels under Industrial Emissions Directive (IED) whereby
environmental performance is assessed. BAT-associated emissions levels (BAT-AEL) and
BAT-associated environmental performance levels (BAT-AEPL) qualify as Type 3 thresholds.56
The UNRSID suggests measuring the performance of companies in terms of impacts on vital
capitals relative to what the standards or sustainability norms must be to ensure the well-being
of stakeholders. The suggestion is to measure the sustainability performance in actual impacts
against normative impacts. The guidance suggests a sustainability quotient whereby the
sustainability performance (S) equals the actual impacts on carrying capacities of vital capitals
(A) divided by normative impacts on carrying capacities of vital capitals (N). These quotients
need to be calculated for each impact driver.57
The Regulation (EU) 2016/1011 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 8 June 2016
on indices used as benchmarks in financial instruments and financial contracts or to measure
the performance of investment funds and amending Directives 2008/48/EC and 2014/17/EU
and Regulation (EU) No 596/2014 sets legal basis to set thresholds for financial instruments.
The questions about identifications, methodology, entity specificity, and responsibility are
defined through a legal analysis of that regulation. This work needs to be done through an
expert that qualifies the different options for the specific instruments, and therefore, these
thresholds stand as a type 1. Similarly, the EU Biodiversity Strategy for 2030 reflects Type 1
thresholds based on a qualitative analysis. 58  These thresholds lack standardized
methodologies for comparison.

3.3 Issues for Implementation and Assurance
3.3.1 Operationalization of Thresholds
The effectiveness of thresholds and benchmarks depends on the quality, consistency, and
comparability of the underlying data. However, sustainability data often faces challenges such
as missing values, inconsistent reporting methodologies, lack of primary data from value
chains, and varying levels of verification across industries. Benchmarks relying on industry
averages may suffer from outdated or incomplete data, making them unreliable for setting
forward-looking thresholds. Therefore, materiality assessments must integrate data quality
checks, third-party verification, and standardized methodologies to ensure thresholds remain
robust and actionable.
Organizational processes are already built into the legislative approach to thresholds in
materiality assessments. As part of the threshold-setting process, businesses need to
demonstrate how responsibility for respecting thresholds is allocated across business
functions, divisions, and units. This is, in the first instance, relevant for first-time adoption, and
in the second instance, for the structure and process of internal audit and external assurance.
Impact valuation plays a key role in the operationalization of thresholds. Fundamentally, the
practice of impact measurement and valuation comprises methods, processes, and standards
for monetizing impacts—impacts are first measured in their fundamental measurement unit
and then multiplied by a value factor that yields a unit of account for the relevant impact driver
expressed in a denominated currency. Impact valuation thus provides information gains in at
least two ways:
Firstly, in the construction of thresholds: Impact materiality assessments are made comparable
across impact drivers that are otherwise measured only by their impact driver-specific units.
This connectivity among impact drivers enhances the robustness of thresholds as decision-
weights for information users.
Secondly, in the application of thresholds: The monetized impacts can be used for further
analysis of the links between financial materiality (already expressed in monetary terms) and
impact materiality. This enhances interoperability and bridges the gap between reporting
systems based on different concepts of materiality.
Thresholds and benchmarks provide a structured way to compare companies’ sustainability
performance. To harness this information gain through impact valuation, the following
considerations must be addressed:


## Page 31


27
•
System and entity boundaries: The logic model and system dynamics are critical for
determining relevant negative and positive impacts across the most significant parts of
a company’s value chain. Relevant impacts of affiliates or joint ventures within the
value chain are not limited by the share of equity held by the company.59 The concept
of operational control can play a role in assessing impact materiality within value chains
and portfolios, with the degree of control over equity, entity, or asset determining
assignment of positive or negative impacts to the appropriate tier of the value chain.
•
Value chain stages: A company’s position within its value chain influences applicable
thresholds as cut-off points in the reference system. Data requirements may vary
across value chain stages; tier 1 suppliers and end-user customers often provide direct
data, while deeper value chain stages may rely on proxies or estimates. Large
companies can use regional or sector averages, EEIO modeling, or data providers to
address data gaps.
•
Intensity-based metrics: In addition to absolute metrics, intensity-based metrics offer
relative insights into larger value chains, diverse portfolios, and conglomerates.60 For
example, they enable resource use or emissions comparisons relative to production
output or revenue. These intensity-based metrics highlight variations in performance
across assets or regions, identifying areas for targeted sustainability improvements.
They also facilitate benchmarking between assets or units of different sizes and
activities. A major limitation arises from the relative nature of these metrics if the
denominator is not chosen carefully. Exogenous effects may misrepresent the true
performance and render the indicator less decision-useful when it comes to pursuing
absolute changes on a transition pathway. Appropriate use of intensity metrics is
exemplified by the Sectoral Decarbonization Approach, as this method ties sector
contributions to the absolute reduction pathway in the overall economy through carbon
budgets.
•
Granularity and skewness: Distribution among divisions in conglomerates and
diverse portfolios can blur an impact assessment, which makes choosing the right level
of granularity all the more important (see section 2.3 above). To provide additional rigor
in the evaluation, the intensity layers method uncovers potential ‘hotspots’, i.e., areas
of disproportionately high impact within a value chain or portfolio. Certain subsidiaries,
assets, or investments can have more impact than others, even if their relative
performance within their sector appears favorable. By considering both the intensity
and absolute effects, companies ensure a more accurate view of impact materiality,
preventing potentially significant impacts from being overlooked due to skewed or
otherwise biased distributions.

Companies are expected to make reasonable
efforts to gather information but are not
required to incur undue costs. This influences
the precision of materiality assessments.
Thresholds, once set, are influenced by data
availability or cost but remain distinct from the
assessment process.
•
Size of the reporting entity: The scale
and complexity of a company’s operations can
influence the specific information needed and
the data available for specific sustainability
topics and impact drivers. Data constraints in
the value chain may lead to differing
approaches among companies of size and
leverage. Listed SMEs fall within the scope of
the ESRS; some are subject to simplified, less
complex requirements.61






3.3.2 Integrating Impact Valuation into Implementation and Assurance
By adhering to the proper sequence—assessing impacts, applying thresholds, and
aggregating significant impacts—entities can eliminate irrelevant data and ensure that
materiality thresholds are addressed accurately. Thorough documentation of the materiality
assessment process is crucial for aligning with ESRS standards and providing clear reasoning
for decisions. Implementing the results within the business context requires a blend of detailed
analysis and qualitative assessments to effectively inform targets, actions, and strategies.

Assurance under the CSRD
According to par 60 et seq. CSRD, limited
assurance is needed to evaluate “compliance
of
the
sustainability
reporting
with
sustainability
reporting
standards,
the
process carried out by the undertaking to
identify the information reported under the
sustainability reporting standards.”
Limited Assurance:
Definition:
“Limited
assurance
engagement―An assurance engagement in
which the practitioner reduces engagement
risk to a level that is acceptable in the
circumstances of the engagement but where
that risk is greater than for a reasonable
assurance engagement. The practitioner’s
conclusion is expressed in a form that
conveys that, based on the procedures
performed,
nothing
has
come
to
the
practitioner’s
attention
to
cause
the
practitioner to believe the subject matter
information is materially misstated. …” (ISAE
3000 8(a)(i)b)
Reasonable Assurance:
Definition:
“Reasonable
assurance
engagement―An assurance engagement in
which the practitioner reduces engagement
risk to an acceptably low level in the
circumstances of the engagement as the
basis for the practitioner’s conclusion. The
practitioner’s conclusion is expressed in a
form that conveys the practitioner’s opinion
on the outcome of the measurement or
evaluation of the underlying subject matter.”
(ISAE 3000 8(a)(i)a)

DMAs occur at the IRO level,62 where the application of impact valuation approaches may
vary. For a data-driven materiality approach, companies should collaborate with advisors and
data service providers to assess the coverage and limitations of relevant topics. While data
gathering takes time, the analysis itself is completed in seconds, providing scientifically
supported and objective assessments. These assessments are then integrated into the CSRD
program workflow to enrich and support stakeholder engagement by validating stakeholder
opinions or challenging and enriching discussions with stakeholders through impact data-led
observations.
Sustainability disclosures should align with the assurance level of the overall statement.63
Audit practitioners can use impact valuation approaches to assess materiality determinations,
validate alignment, and address differences. ESRS, including ESRS E1, allow referencing
assured information from other reports, such as corporate governance statements, to avoid
duplicate reporting. 64 Debates exist on whether auditors should evaluate the process (EU
Commission FAQ view) or its description (e.g., German IDW).
3.3.3 Approaches and Options for Integration
Auditors focus on entity-specific and contextual information to ascertain whether material
impacts have been identified by the principles, procedures, and methods that the preparing
company has set out. Such assurance of materiality assessments does not serve to validate
the data per se or give an opinion about the effectiveness of the monitoring systems, i.e.,
whether they enable effective sustainability management for changes in positive impacts and
actual outcomes.
Under the CSRD, companies obtain one of two levels of assurance65:
•
Limited assurance: A moderate level of verification where assurance practitioners
conclude that no material misstatements about sustainability information were found.
•
Reasonable assurance: An advanced level of verification where assurance
practitioners conclude that the sustainability information is prepared, in all material
respects, in accordance with the applicable criteria.

As reporting practices mature, regulators are expected to transition from limited to reasonable
assurance, increasing expectations for audit-quality data and impact valuation.

Regulatory bodies are expected to enhance the assurance level from limited to reasonable
assurance in the future, aiming to align financial and sustainability reporting by 2028, when
EU assurance standards for sustainability reporting are implemented. 66 IAASB’s standard
ISSA 5000, finalized in 2024, serves as the basis for EU assurance standards.67
Two options exist in terms of how impact valuation can drive the audit process:
•
Top-down: Audit firms collaborate through industry associations to standardize impact
valuation. Some highlight how impact valuation benefits audits by aligning financial
metrics with reporting practices.
•
Bottom-up: Impact valuation providers work with sustainability teams and advisors to
integrate impact valuation into double materiality assessments, as highlighted by ZF,
KPMG, and the World Economic Forum,68 as well as Deloitte.69 Solution providers70
enable assurance-ready impact valuation for CSRD through advanced data and
software platforms.71 Companies should ensure that any solution suits the need for
internal control and auditable data flows, end-to-end.
3.3.4 Impact Data and Management Systems (IDMS)
Impact valuation complements Impact Data and Management Systems (IDMS) for both limited
and reasonable assurance engagements. Existing IDMS enable detailed testing and validation
of output and impact data, increasing confidence in the accuracy of reported information and
estimates. Impact measurement and valuation play an important role in supporting the
disclosure of transparent methodologies and processes, which are essential for both limited
and reasonable assurance engagements.
Auditors can conduct more extensive testing and validation procedures with reliable IDMS to
assess data accuracy. This can be resource-intensive and requires closer collaboration with
the company. Without IDMS, companies face challenges in assurance and impact valuation,
potentially hindering their ability to meet evolving regulatory expectations. While fragmented
output data (manually collected or poorly documented, with challenges in traceability and
accuracy) may still suffice for limited assurance, companies can strengthen the reliability and
accuracy of reported information by incorporating monetization, impact accounting,
measurement and valuation using widely accepted methodologies and processes.

4 Outlook and Future Sprints
As for impact accounting in CSRD audits, market participants are learning from assurance
engagements for financial year (FY) 2024 (reported in 2025), with this initial cohort driving
global implementation and audit capabilities, while embedding best practices across sectors.
By FY 2025 (reported in 2026), more companies will need to reach this stage. Impact valuation
can face limitations when value factors are unavailable for material impacts, if the factors fail
to address potential or non-consolidated outputs, when disaggregated disclosure is required,
or if the process is driven by risks or opportunities. These challenges must be addressed in
future Sprints.
We encourage further research and development relating to the usability, presentation, and
relevance of thresholds and benchmarks for different information user groups. It is crucial to
distinguish between policy and technical challenges when constructing thresholds and
benchmarks. As practitioners, regulators, and stakeholders intensify cross-sector
collaboration in the coming years, future Sprint themes and tasks can include:
Policy Tasks:
1. Interoperability and connectivity: Policymakers, standard-setters, professional
services, and civil society organizations should engage in cross-sector partnerships to
ensure interoperability among conceptual frameworks of different standards and
connectivity between financial and sustainability reporting in developing, setting, and
applying thresholds and benchmarks.
2. Best practices in valuing impact materiality: It would be desirable to develop
generally accepted standards on using impact valuation so companies can set
thresholds independently and auditors have clarity on what is included in an assurance
engagement. As auditors cannot audit the approaches they are proposing in advisory
or engagements, there need to be adequate provisions to ensures independence and
avoids conflicts of interest.
3. Advisory and pre-audit consultations: Early auditor involvement streamlines
assurance by enabling pre-audit consultations to improve data infrastructure, process
documentation, and disclosure approaches, reducing efforts and costs.
4. Scaling capacity building and learning: Engaging early with assurance providers
builds capacity, improves data management, and strengthens credibility, preparing
companies for mandated assurance requirements despite added complexity.
5. Risk of material misstatements: Inadequate data infrastructure heightens the risk of
material misstatements in sustainability reporting under CSRD. Assurance providers
must highlight these risks and limitations to governance bodies.
6. Presentation of decision-useful and relevant data: Effective sustainability reporting
relies on presenting clear, decision-useful data tailored to stakeholder needs.
Companies must align disclosures with materiality thresholds and communicate
impacts in a format that supports informed decision making by stakeholders.


## Page 36


32
Technical Tasks:
1. Interoperability and connectivity: The technical development of thresholds of
different maturity levels require collaboration spanning multiple disciplines from natural
sciences, engineering, to social sciences, and professional services from the
perspective of information users.
2. Method-standard-process fitness: Testing, feedback, and calibration of methods to
ensure appropriateness for different maturity levels and impact drivers.
3. Additionality of positive impacts: Ensuring that positive impacts are truly
incremental, leveraging the business model to align investments and activities with
sustainability objectives beyond business-as-usual.
4. Attribution rules: Establishing clear attribution rules at the nexus of entities and their
actual and potential impacts based on the current state of the art and science.
5. Temporality: Enabling management systems to adjust thresholds over time (e.g.,
tipping points); adaptation of benchmarks over time.
6. Treatments of interdependencies: Addressing how interconnected impacts, risks,
and opportunities are managed and assessed in sustainability reporting.
5 Conclusion
This report pursued three objectives. First, to clarify and specify the concepts of thresholds
and benchmarks for materiality assessment under the CSRD from a usability perspective.
Second, we developed a framework to evaluate the extent to which different threshold
approaches and methods meet the criteria of comparability and entity-specificity. Finally, we
provide an overview of and begin to test the usability of different threshold approaches and
methods. This work is based on a collaborative sprint involving leading solution providers and
users of impact valuation around the world.
Our key insights are relevant for decision-makers and experts in business, policy, and civil
society. The first contribution is related to the construction of thresholds. Since the threshold
approaches and methods vary widely in terms of scale, scope, and likelihood, it is important
to determine the maturity level of each impact driver independently. And as materiality
thresholds are decision weights, the selection of threshold methods should be based on the
specific information user experience: their usability, relevance, and presentation. This process
needs to be connected to a technical assessment of the fundamental physical flows (and
stocks) that are specific to each of the impact drivers, either on inputs, activities, outputs, or a
combination of them.
From this follows the second insight that pertains to the application of thresholds in materiality
judgments. The usability of thresholds and benchmarks depends on the ability to aggregate
and disaggregate different measures across impact drivers. Scoring, rating, and valuation
approaches to impact materiality in combination with measured entity-specific data offer the


## Page 37


33
highest degree of entity-specificity while allowing for comparability across entities (type 4).
This high degree of operationalization not only exceeds the minimum disclosure obligations
for material disclosures under the CSRD but also allows for forward-looking information on
positive impacts that are both entity-specific and comparable.
Third, the usability matrix allows pathways for combining different methods, namely when and
how to combine them. Consolidating aggregate and disaggregate measures may not be
possible in all cases, and data may be insufficient given the cost-benefit constraints of
information preparers and users. As sustainability reporting evolves under the CSRD and
other global standards, companies seeking to move from compliance to innovation should
consider the use of impact valuation.
Furthermore, the interdependence of impact drivers and, in turn, materiality thresholds require
approaches and methods that ensure the connectivity across financial, natural, social, and
human capitals. For thresholds to become meaningful and decision-useful, they need to
translate data on physical flows and stocks into standardized impact information. To achieve
this, the market participants require structured data governance as well as sector-specific or
product-specific benchmarks. Emerging best practices and evolving regulatory expectations
will continue to shape how sustainability performance is assessed, requiring companies to
stay adaptive and forward-looking.
Additionally, while benchmarks serve as valuable reference points for assessing sustainability
performance, they must be carefully contextualized with regulatory thresholds, scientific
findings, and stakeholder considerations to ensure that materiality assessments drive
meaningful action. Benchmarks alone do not establish materiality; instead, they provide
comparability that must be adjusted to reflect product-specific, sector-specific or geographic
risks, emerging sustainability priorities, and evolving legal frameworks. Companies that
effectively integrate benchmarks into a structured threshold-setting approach will be better
positioned to align with investor expectations, sustainability reporting obligations, and long-
term value creation.
Many sustainability disclosures rely on estimated figures, sector averages, or self-reported
data, creating potential inconsistencies that impact comparability and reliability. Companies
can enhance data governance, integrate third-party verification, and refine methodologies to
align sustainability disclosures with assurance requirements, ensuring credibility and
consistency. Robust data management systems, including Impact Data and Management
Systems (IDMS), will play a vital role in preparing organizations for the transition toward
reasonable assurance under the CSRD.

34
Further work is necessary to enhance the usability of impact information given the cost-benefit
constraints of preparers and users. Understanding data quality requires testing for “standard-
method-process fitness” specifies data for concrete decisions from the information user
experience. This approach to decision-usefulness should be given precedence over seeking
an abstract and unachievable data quality standard irrespective of the decision user case.
Therefore, the verifiability of material, decision-useful impact information expands the
knowledge base from traditional financial audit to professional expertise founded in the natural
sciences, engineering, and social sciences.
As sustainability standards mature and assurance requirements increase, companies that
take early steps to integrate impact valuation, data-driven materiality assessments, and robust
assurance processes will be best positioned to demonstrate accountability and transparency.
Moving forward, cross-sector collaboration, regulatory alignment, and continuous learning will
be critical in refining how thresholds and benchmarks shape sustainable business practices,
ensuring that corporate activities translate into meaningful decreases of negative impacts and
increases of positive impacts in social and ecological systems.

Annex
1. Technical Note
Impact accounting provides a quantitative and qualitative approach to assessing a company’s
impact on the environment, society, and the economy. This information supports the
effectiveness of materiality assessment for validating statements made in sustainability
reports and conducting audits, especially in the context of double materiality assessments
under CSRD and upcoming regulations like ESRS and ISSA 5000. ISSA 5000 is an assurance
standard for assurance providers, while ESRS is a reporting standard for entities in the scope
of CSRD. As a data-driven process, impact accounting can translate impacts into comparable
financial metrics, offering concrete evidence to substantiate claims about positive or negative
contributions. This strengthens the credibility of sustainability reports, fostering trust with
stakeholders. In this context, impact accounting assists in identifying and prioritising material
impacts, ensuring that reported information focuses on issues that genuinely matter to the
company and its stakeholders. Companies can thus track progress over time by quantifying
and monetizing impacts, demonstrating accountability and commitment to improvement.
By linking WifOR's ESRS-impact driver mapping (below) to materiality thresholds and impact
benchmarks, users can create a scalable matrix that differentiates between various threshold
types and benchmark scopes. Each row represents a specific impact driver (e.g., forced labor,
carbon emissions), with the following two new columns to classify the threshold type and
benchmark scope based on impact driver characteristics. Threshold type distinguishes
between binary thresholds (e.g., zero-tolerance for forced labor) and gradual thresholds (e.g.,
phased reductions for carbon emissions). The benchmark scope column specifies whether the
benchmark applies locally (e.g., air and water pollution) or globally (e.g., carbon emissions).
Decision-makers provide ongoing, crowd-sourced, updated mapping for consistent integration
and comparability. Where industry or stakeholder consensus exists, impact accounting
frameworks populate the usability matrix per impact driver with appropriate thresholds and
benchmarks. Where no consensus exists, solution providers may tailor their approach by
sector or industry, indicating areas requiring further alignment. The mapping extension
categorizes thresholds by impact intensity and reach, adapted to the specific value stage or
portfolio. Specificity is assessed case by case: binary thresholds with local scope address
immediate, severe local impacts (e.g., forced labor), while gradual thresholds with a global
scope enable progressive management of broader challenges (e.g., carbon emissions).
