# transitionvaluation
This open-source repository contains XBRL-based schemas, codes, and databases for the valuation of transition plans primarily for use by asset owners, asset managers, and impact valuation providers. It is curated by the members of the Transition Valuation Partnership under the custodianship of Greenings, the Swiss-based non-profit organization for sustainable transitions.
