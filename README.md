## 1. Project: Transition Valuation
## 2. Description:
This open-source repository contains resources for the valuation of corporate transitions to net zero. The intended users are researchers, analysts, and developers for academic and professional applications, primarily in the fields of sustainability and finance: asset owners, asset managers, impact valuation providers, policy-makers and regulators. This repo is curated by the project managers and sprint teams of the Transition Valuation Partnership under the custodianship of Greenings, the Swiss-based non-profit organization for sustainable transitions.

Guide: Steps to Valuing Impact Materiality 
Impact Assessment 
1.	Each of the severity characteristics (scale, scope, irremediability) can have a severe impact, even if only one dimension (e.g., scale) has a high value (ESRS 1. AR 11). This must be considered, especially when working with models using averages or aggregate values. The average and the range of severity characteristics are essential. However, if one characteristic gets the highest rating, it does not necessarily mean the topic is material.
2.	In the case of potential negative human rights impacts, severity takes precedence over likelihood (ESRS 1. AR 11). While likelihood doesn’t always need to be set to 100%, severity should be prioritized in assessments.
3.	Follow the correct order: 1) assess impacts, 2) apply thresholds, and 3) aggregate significant impacts to map them to Sustainability Matters. Skipping steps or reversing the order can mix material and non-material impacts, resulting in misleading average values below materiality thresholds.
4.	Ensure proper documentation: Complete and adequate documentation of the DMA process should be maintained, including the reasoning behind the materiality assessments and their alignment with ESRS standards.

Integrating Impact Valuation 
The document suggests a three-step approach to integrating Impact Measurement and Valuation (IMV) into the Double Materiality Assessment (DMA) process. These steps are:
Step A – Quantitative Impact Materiality: This step involves selecting and monetizing the key impacts relevant to the organization. The goal is to quantify the organization’s environmental, social, and economic impacts in monetary terms.
Step B – Stakeholder Input: This step involves gathering input from stakeholders on the materiality of the impacts identified in Step A. The goal is to ensure that the assessment reflects the perspectives of those who are affected by the organization’s activities.
Step C – Integrating the Quantitative and Qualitative Results: This step involves combining the quantitative data from Step A with the qualitative input from Step B. The goal is to create a comprehensive and balanced assessment of the organization’s material impacts.

Assurance Readiness 
1.	The scope of the impact assessment, including the environmental, social, and economic factors to be considered, is defined. 
2.	Align objectives with relevant standards (e.g., GRI, ESRS) to ensure comprehensive coverage of sustainability issues and reporting requirements. 
3.	Choose metrics that accurately reflect the company’s impacts and align with industry best practices.
4.	Selecting suitable methodologies for data collection, measurement, and valuation is essential, and incorporating industry benchmarks can help identify relative negative and positive impacts, providing context for performance assessment and gathering reliable and verifiable data from various sources, including internal systems, surveys, and external databases. This step is especially essential for including topics that do not follow a standardized methodological approach, such as those approved by the Valuation & Technical Practitioner Committee (VTPC). A company can create its impact methodology for a topic that needs to be covered by impact methodologies.
5.	Conduct rigorous analysis to quantify and qualify impacts, using industry benchmarks to contextualize findings and highlight areas for improvement. 
6.	Documenting data collection processes and processing procedures ensures comprehensive coverage of sustainability issues and reporting topics. Overall, utilizing impact data to assess impact and financial materiality ensures a thorough assessment of sustainability issues and reporting topics. Industry benchmarks can inform this assessment by indicating significant impacts relative to peers, helping prioritize areas of focus. Thresholds can be utilized to determine materiality and non-materiality. 
7.	Prepare a clear and transparent report that discloses relevant impact information, IROs, including materiality assessments, key metrics, and progress towards sustainability goals (if applicable). 
8.	Communicate findings to stakeholders effectively, leveraging industry benchmarks to illustrate performance relative to peers for positive and negative impacts that are assured and verified.  
9.	Engaging with independent assurance providers to verify the accuracy and completeness of impact data collection, analysis, and reporting enhances credibility and stakeholder trust. This verification process can also incorporate industry benchmarks, reinforcing the significance of reported impacts and fostering stakeholder confidence in the company’s sustainability efforts.
