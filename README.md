# transitionvaluation
This open-source repository contains resources for the valuation of corporate transitions to net zero. The intended users are researchers, analysts, and developers for academic and professional applications, primarily in the fields of sustainability and finance in collaboration with asset owners, asset managers, and impact valuation providers. It is curated by the members of the Transition Valuation Partnership under the custodianship of Greenings, the Swiss-based non-profit organization for sustainable transitions.
